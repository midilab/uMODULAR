# uMODULAR

uMODULAR is a **hardware** schematic and printed circuit board collection of usefull and **reusable modules** focused on user/machine/mechanical interface for **audio and visual** protocols control.

The modular architecture make it easier to **create and build** your own **controller** and/or **signal processing box** for the control and/or integration of **different audio and video protocols** setups.

All the hardware modules are designed with interoperability in mind, so you can possibly write your self a sequencer that controls events for MIDI, OSC, CV, DMX and a mechanical device - like a robot - all together in the painless possible way.

## Hardware

Modules released under CC-BY-SA 4.0 

## Drivers

All the interfacing is done using a driver and interface library called uInterface to be released on july.

## Software

StepSequencer, Midi/CV/DMX controller, Generative music are some standards for uMODULAR project, all that librarys and apps are writed and tested and ready to be released, i just need to work on documentation
