uMODULAR is a **hardware** collection of usefull and **reusable modules** focused on **audio and visual** technology usage.

The modular architecture make it easier to **create and build** your own **controller** and/or **signal processing box** for the control and/or integration of **different audio and video protocols** setups.

All the hardware modules are designed with interoperability in mind, so you can possibly write your self a sequencer that controls events for MIDI, OSC, CV, DMX and a mechanical device - like a robot - all together in the painless possible way.
