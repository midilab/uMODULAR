#### uCtrl

[uCtrl](https://github.com/midilab/uCtrl) is a comprehensive codebase library for the uMODULAR hardware project. It offers a driver layer for all uMODULAR modules and a user interface layer that simplifies the creation, extension, and sharing of advanced Arduino/PlatformIO applications.  
  
With uCtrl, you can achieve realtime-like functionality within the Arduino/PlatformIO ecosystem by leveraging hardware timer interruptions for precise task management. The library provides a resource-safe access through its API, ensuring efficient and reliable operation.  
  
Choose uCtrl for developing robust, portable, and high-performance musical instruments, sequencers, audio/video controllers, and other related machines on the Arduino/PlatformIO platform.  
  
#### uClock

[uClock](https://github.com/midilab/uClock) is a BPM-based Clock Generator Library provides a way to implement BPM clock tick calls using hardware interruption, ensuring the tightest and most accurate clock signal possible.  

## Applications

Real world applications using the uMODULAR framework:  

#### Aciduino V2

The project features a versatile step sequencer clone of Rolandâ€™s TB303/TR808, offering up to 16 tracks. It includes a comprehensive automation grid system for step, pattern, and mute control. The sequencer functions as a MIDI controller and incorporates an OLED display for visual feedback. Furthermore, the design is modular and allows for easy expansion with additional potentiometers, buttons, MIDI, or CV/Gate interfaces.  
  
You can download the app at [aciduino v2 repository](https://github.com/midilab/aciduino/tree/master/v2)
